                    For my web projects, I designed and build two websites. The first one is for a Landscaping company. The website provides information about the companies' activities. Five of the royalty free high quality images were bought from Shutterstock to attract customers' attention and ensure a pleasant look, others were downloaded from a free images database. The Second werbsite is build for a fictional company that offers flower bulbs. All the images related to plants and flowers were taken by Flower Council of Holland website. They could be downloaded for free of charge and royalty-free from their Image Bank, however it is not allowed to change them. In this portfolio are included only images for the Landscaping website.

A lower tonal width will only affect the deep shadows and a larger tonal width will affect the deep shadows and the dark grays. Shadows Fade Amount – 7%, Tonal Width – 9% is chosen.</li>
